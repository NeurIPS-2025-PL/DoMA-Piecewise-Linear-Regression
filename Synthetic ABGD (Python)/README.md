# Using AB-GD in Python: 
```bash
## Install Requirements (Numpy & Matplotlib)
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Run
python main_DMaX.py

```
The `Variable Setup` code section in `main_DMaX.py` (lines 10-17) defines the list of all simulation settings
parameters that can be changed to the user's liking. 

A figure with ground truth and estimated model will pop up when `plotme = True` and `d<3`.
Otherwise, the console will always print the results.
